# Multivariate-Pattern-Similarity-Analysis
This repo includes a useful software library and example code
to perform MVPA/MPS/representational similarity analysis with fMRI data.


This MATLAB code is a slightly updated version of the code used for the following articles:

Complementary roles of human hippocampal subregions during retrieval of 
   spatiotemporal context. (2014). MS Copara, AS Hassan, CT Kyle, LA Libby, 
   C Ranganath, AD Ekstrom. Journal of Neuroscience 34 (20), 6834-6842

Stokes, J., Kyle, C., & Ekstrom, A. D. (2015). Complementary Roles of 
   Human Hippocampal Subfields in Differentiation and Integration of 
   Spatial Context. Journal of Cognitive Neuroscience.

Successful retrieval of competing spatial environments in humans involves 
   hippocampal pattern separation mechanisms. (2015). CT Kyle, JD Stokes, 
   JS Lieberman, AS Hassan, AD Ekstrom Elife 4, e10499

This code assumes that a recent version of SPM is in your matlab path
The full searchlight analysis uses Advanced normalization tools to perform
non-rigid registraion.  That can be installed [here](https://github.com/stnava/ANTs)
